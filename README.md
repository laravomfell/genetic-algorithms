# Genetic algorithms in R

This repo provides code for five common optimization algorithms to optimize ensemble selection. I coded four evolutionary algorithms plus a primitive version of stochastic hill-climbing. The following algorithms are implemented:

1. Genetic Algorithm 
2. Backtracking Search Optimization as proposed by Civicioglu (2013)
3. Population-Based Incremental Learning by Baluja (1994)
4. Particle Swarm Optimization
5. (Stochastic hill-climbing)

The included paper in the "paper" folder showcases their use for ensemble selection of predictions used in the Data Mining Cup. 

The original data cannot be uploaded on GitHub. I will soon upload a codefile showcasing the use of the algorithms on a toy dataset.
